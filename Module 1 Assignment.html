    <h1>Microsoft's India Story</h1>
    <p>Microsoft enables digital transformation for the era of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge. Its mission
        is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Microsoft set up its India
        operations in 1990. Microsoft in India offers its global cloud services from local data centers to accelerate
        digital transformation across Indian start-ups, businesses, and government.

        We help businesses reimagine how they bring together people, data, and processes to create value for their
        customers and maintain a competitive advantage in a digital-first world.

        We partner with organizations to transform them into a digital company by developing new capabilities to engage
        better with their customers, empower their employees, optimize their operations, and transform their products.
    </p>

    <h2>Trust & Security</h2>
    <p>

        Our Cyber Security Engagement Center, headquartered in Delhi, brings together our capabilities to foster deeper
        collaborations with public and private sector organizations, a critical enabler for India’s digital
        transformation.

        Microsoft’s approach to cybersecurity in today’s cloud-centric world rests on three core functional areas:
        protect, detect, and respond. To support a comprehensive, cross-company and cross-industry approach to
        cybersecurity, Microsoft invests more than a billion dollars a year in security research, innovation, and
        development.
    </p>


    <h3>Innovation and AI for All</h3>
    <p>
        As humankind discovers new challenges and refocuses on old ones, AI can help us find better and more sustainable
        solutions. The intersection with people and society presents an incredible opportunity to create a lasting,
        positive impact on the world and in India.

        We aim to democratize AI to make it available to all. Our partners use our cognitive services, IoT, and machine
        learning models to create inclusive solutions designed to solve societal and business problems.
    </p>

    <h4>Local Language Computing</h4>
    <p>
        At Microsoft, we believe that for India to become truly digital, we need to make technology accessible and
        productive for all, irrespective of the language they may speak or read.

        To break the language barrier, we started working with Indian languages two decades ago and launched Project
        Bhasha in 1998 to accelerate computing in Indian languages. We have come a long way since then – supporting text
        input in all 22 constitutionally recognized Indian languages across our products, and Windows interface-support
        in 12 languages. Bhasha India provides computing tools for Indic languages.

    <h5>Digital Transformation in India</h5>
    <p>

        We help businesses reimagine how they bring together people, data, and processes to create value for their
        customers and maintain a competitive advantage in a digital-first world.

        We partner with organizations to transform them into a digital company by developing new capabilities to engage
        better with their customers, empower their employees, optimize their operations, and transform their products.
    </p>
    <h6>Intelligent Cloud for India</h6>
    <p>

        We believe the key to realizing the vision for India’s growth has cloud at its core. We partner with
        governments, as well as private and public institutions to develop cloud-based technological solutions to
        digitally transform every sector in India.

        We also have three data centers in India to fuel India’s inclusive growth, spur innovation, and accelerate
        digital transformation.
